# flutter-sheets
flutter application to read and write google sheets [catsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jyKoInSV74FM7iSPGm5Pl8q-y4SwAM5uMHNkcMP2sMg/edit#gid=0)

## [Add Dropdown List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV5Ev_hI4Qo) based on [dropdown-list-in-flutter](http://www.coderzheaven.com/2019/04/16/dropdown-list-in-flutter/)

1. Create List Data Class [TC 0:45](https://youtu.be/yV5Ev_hI4Qo?t=45)
```
class Whopile {
  int id;
  String name;
  Whopile(this.id, this.name);
  static List<Whopile> getWhopile() {
    return <Whopile>[
      Whopile(1, 'AL'),
      Whopile(2, 'Carla'),
      Whopile(3, 'Chris'),
      Whopile(4, 'Carol'),
    ];
  }
}
```
2. Create DropDownState
```
tbd
```
3. Call DropDown List in UI
```
tbd
```
